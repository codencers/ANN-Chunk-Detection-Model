## 🧠 Overview

This is a personal machine learning project built to practice **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for **customer churn prediction**.

The model takes customer information as input and predicts whether the customer is likely to **leave or stay**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Streamlit

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters customer details  
2. Data is preprocessed and scaled  
3. ANN model generates prediction  
4. Output: **Churn / No Churn**
